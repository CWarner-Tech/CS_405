Secure Coding
In CS 405, I focused on building secure software using SEI CERT C++ coding standards. One of the key lessons was not leaving security to the end. Instead, I learned to build security into each step of development. I completed a Security Policy Template that included 10 secure coding standards and explained how each one helps protect software from common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and improper input handling.

For Project Two, I created a narrated presentation that included a threat matrix, encryption strategy, and recommendations for applying the Triple-A framework (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting). I also wrote and ran unit tests using Google Test and used tools like Visual Studio and Cppcheck for static code analysis. These helped me catch issues early and understand how automated tools support secure development.

The concept of Zero Trust stood out the most. It changed how I view system access and helped me understand the importance of verifying users, securing endpoints, and limiting access by default. This course gave me real experience with writing secure code and showed me how to think like a security-focused developer. I plan to keep using these tools and strategies in future projects.
